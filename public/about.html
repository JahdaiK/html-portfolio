<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr/>
<p>Im Jahdai! A 31 year old Zillenial who hates adulting. I wish money magically fell from the sky without effecting inflation.</p>

<p>I was born in Brooklyn but I went to high school in Connecticut and college in D.C. (All Hail the Buff and Blue!) </p>

<p>I am currently learning to code so I can find out if I want to be a software engineer. I am currently leaning towards front end but who knows what I might decide.</p>
